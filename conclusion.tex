\chapter{Conclusion}

In this report we first started with the basidc definitions and principals of machine learning and safety assurance concept and eplored some of the fundamentals in both areas in Chapter \ref{chap:ML} and Chapter \ref{chap:safety} we also glanced currently trending research in these areas. Finally, in Chapter \ref{chap:literature} we reviewed some of the literature in assurance of ML systems and some of the open challenges and research questions in each step of ML lifecycle. Despite significant research into some stages of ML lifecycle, more research is needed in other parts. For example, explainable models, there are no global methods providing insights into complex ML models.  % \textcolor{red}{State some of the major open challenges I found,}
