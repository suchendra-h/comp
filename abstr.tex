Machine Learning (ML) has become one of the fastest growing fields of science in recent years. The theories and technologies underpinning ML are used in a vast number of industrial and scientific applications, including banking, security, automotive and healthcare. Although it is becoming more prevalent to use ML technologies in safety critical settings such as healthcare and aerospace, there is still a significant need to assure safety of such systems. In this report, we will first take a look at the foundations of ML and safety. Next we review some of the methods currently developed for safety assurance in ML. We present these methods using a conceptual model based on four stages of ML: Data Management, Model Training, Model Verification and Model Deployment. We identify some of the open research areas associated with each stage.
