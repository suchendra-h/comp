Machine Learning (ML) has become one of the fastest growing fields of science in recent years. The related technologies are used in vast number of industrial and scientific applications. Although it is becoming more prevalent to use ML technologies in safety critical systems such as healthcare and aerospace, there is still a significant need to assure safety of such systems. In this report, we will first take a look at the basics of ML and safety. Next we review some of the methods currently developed for safety assurance in ML. Which involves four stages of ML: Data Management, Model Training, Model Verification and Model Deployment. Finally, we identify some of the open research areas in each stage.
