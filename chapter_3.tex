\chapter{Machine Learning}
Machine learning algorithms can extract patterns and learn from data \cite{IanGoodfellow2016}. A brief definition of learning can be given as \cite{mitchell1997machine}
\begin{displayquote}[][]
    "A computer program is said to learn from experience \textit{E} with respect to some class of tasks \textit{T} and performance measure \textit{P}, if its performance at tasks in \textit{T}, as measured by \textit{P}, improves with experience \textit{E}."
\end{displayquote}

A task is the main objective of using an ML algorithm. For example, in an autonomous vehicle, driving the car is the task. A task is not the process of learning. Learning is used as a means to achieve an ability to accomplish a task \cite{IanGoodfellow2016}. With developments in ML methods, they have been applied to different tasks, some examples of tasks are classification, regrassion, transcription, machine translation, denoising \cite{IanGoodfellow2016}.

The performance measure is used to quantify how successfully a task is accomplished, equivalently, number of erroneous outputs could be used as a way of indicating a method's performance.
